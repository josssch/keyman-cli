# SSH Key Swapper

This is a simple CLI tool that allows you to easily swap between different SSH keys on your machine.

I am aware projects like this exist, but I wanted to create my own version as a simple side-project.

## Todo

- [x] Ensure all errors are handled
    - [x] Organize subcommands into their own functions
- [ ] Add more options
- [ ] Installation docs, usage, etc.
- [ ] Add CI/CD via GitHub Actions
